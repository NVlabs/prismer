#Please refer to http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/ to look at the conditions of using the dataset MJSynth.
#
#The following vocabulary was compiled as follows:
#1)we downloaded http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/mjsynth.tar.gz
#2)we split each line in mnt/ramdisk/max/90kDICT32pxannotation.txt by the underscores and keeper the second string.
#3)we converted all strings to upper case, and removed any strings containing digits or being shorter than 3 characters.
#4)we sorted the remaining strings in ascending order.
